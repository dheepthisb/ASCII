# ASCII

C program that will prompt for and accept two 4-digit hexadecimal numbers and then combine them (i.e., not add them) into a single 32-bit number and print out the results.

The user is prompted to read two 4 digit hexadecimal numbers(we assume the user enters hexadeciman number only). The entered hexadecimal number might be out of range and in that case the user must be prompted to enter another number until we get two valid hexa numbers.

1. we will print decimal representation of the given numbers
2. we will concatenate two 4 digit hexadecimal numbers into a single 8 digit hexa decimal number using bit manipulation. Here the 1st number will be in the least 4 significant digit and the 2nd number in the 4 most significant digit.

the concatenated numbers will be converted to decimal.
